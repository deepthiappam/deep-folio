Hello World! I'm Deepthi, a graduate from IIT Kharagpur, working currently as Software Developer. With a passion for new experiences, I thrive in challenging environments. I taught myself software skills, and also open to learn when it comes to getting the task done.

I am pet enthusiast, an aquarium hobbiest and love to take care of animals. Gardening is one of my hobby, which helps me relax. Apart from these, I enjoy playing video games and listening to music.

I love to travel and experience various people and cultures. I plan to travel across the world in near future. I am not a fitness enthusiast, constantly trying to be better everyday.

Let's connect to exchange insights, collaborate on exciting projects, or engage in thought-provoking discussions. I look forward to connecting with like-minded professionals who share the same enthusiasm for growth and innovation.
